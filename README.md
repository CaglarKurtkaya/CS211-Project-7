# CS211-Project-7
What is the Fastest Way to Get from Here to There?-C++ Program to represent a travel network as was done with Project 6. 
This travel network will use an array of linked lists as its primary storage structure. This type of storage structure is typically called an “adjacency list”. 
The main difference is here we want to do a Breadth First Search to find the short path between locations in the travel network.
